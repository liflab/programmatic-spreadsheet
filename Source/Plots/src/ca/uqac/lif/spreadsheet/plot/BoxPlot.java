/**
 * A "box and whiskers" diagram displaying statistics about one or more
 * data series. Given a table in the following format:
 * 
 * <table border="1">
 * <tr><th>x</th><th>Min</th><th>Q1</th><th>Q2</th><th>Q3</th><th>Max</th></tr>
 * <tr><td>A</td><td>&hellip;</td><td>&hellip;</td><td>&hellip;</td><td>&hellip;</td><td>&hellip;</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>B</td><td>&hellip;</td><td>&hellip;</td><td>&hellip;</td><td>&hellip;</td><td>&hellip;</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>C</td><td>&hellip;</td><td>&hellip;</td><td>&hellip;</td><td>&hellip;</td><td>&hellip;</td></tr>
 * </table>
 * a boxplot will display it like this:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * ^
 * |  ---
 * |   |       ---      ---
 * |   |        |        |

 * +---+--------+--------+----------&gt;
 *     A        B        C
 * 
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The position of the lines and box boundaries in each data series correspond
 * the the min/max values and quartiles of that series.
