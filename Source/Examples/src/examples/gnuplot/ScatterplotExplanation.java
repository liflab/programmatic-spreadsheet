/**
 * Displays a scatterplot from a spreadsheet extracted from a file, and answers
 * a provenance query on the contents of the plot.
 * <p>
 * The scatterplot is identical to that of {@link ScatterplotSimple}, except
 * that it is parsed from a text file instead of being hard-coded. Thus, the
 * following picture is displayed:
 * <p>
 * <img src="{@docRoot}/doc-files/gnuplot/ScatterplotSimple-window.png" alt="Plot" />
 * <p>
 * The program then asks an explanation for the legend of this plot (top-right
 * corner); this is done using the {@link ChartPart.Legend} part. 
 * <p>
 * <img src="{@docRoot}/doc-files/gnuplot/ScatterplotExplanation-exp.png" alt="Explanation graph" />
 * <p>
 * As one can see by examining the leaves of the graph, the plot's legend can
 * be traced to two character ranges inside the input text file:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Line 1, characters 11-16: the part of the first input line corresponding
 * to the word "Apples"</li>
 * <li>Line 1, characters 18-24: the part of the first input line corresponding
 * to the word "Oranges"</li>
 * </ul>
 * @see ScatterplotSimple
