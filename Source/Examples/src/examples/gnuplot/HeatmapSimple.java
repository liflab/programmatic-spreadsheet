/**
 * Creates and displays a heat map based on a list of pairs of numbers.
 * <p>
 * The program starts by creating the following list of pairs of
 * <tt>double</tt>: [(1,1), (3,5), (2,1), (7,3)]. The interval for the first
 * coordinate is set to [0,12] and is split into 4 regions. The interval for
 * the second coordinate is set to [0,6] and is split into 3 regions. Picking a
 * region for the first and second coordinate delineates a "cell". The goal is
 * to count how many pairs of the input list fall into each cell.
 * <p>
 * This is done with an instance of the {@link GetFrequencies} function, which
 * is evaluated on the list of pairs above. It produces the following
 * spreadsheet:
 * <p>
 * <table border="1">
 * <tr><th></th><th>0</th><th>3</th><th>6</th><th>9</th></tr>
 * <tr><th>0</th><td style="background:yellow">2</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
 * <tr><th>2</th><td>0</td><td>0</td><td style="background:lightgreen">1</td><td>0</td></tr>
 * <tr><th>4</th><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
 * </table>
 * <p>
 * Indeed, we can observe for example that two pairs of the list have their
 * first value in the interval [0,3) and their second value in the interval
 * [0,2) (yellow cell); one pair has its first value in the interval [6,9) and
 * its second value in the interval [2,4) (green cell); and so on.
 * <p>
 * Once in possession of this spreadsheet, it is possible to display its
 * contents as a two-dimensional plot using the {@link HeatMap} chart class.
 * This produces the following picture:
 * <p>
 * <img src="{@docRoot}/doc-files/gnuplot/HeatmapSimple-window.png" alt="Window" />
 * <p>
 * Notice how the vertical axis is reversed with respect to the contents of the
 * spreadsheet.
