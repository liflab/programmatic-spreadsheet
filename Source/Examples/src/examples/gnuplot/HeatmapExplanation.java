/**
 * Creates a heat map and answers a provenance query about an element of the
 * resulting chart.
 * <p>
 * This program is a follow-up to {@link HeatmapSimple}. It creates the same
 * heatmap, but uses the {@link DrawChart} function to obtain the picture:
 * <p>
 * <img src="{@docRoot}/doc-files/gnuplot/HeatmapSimple-window.png" alt="Window" />
 * <p>
 * The advantage is that this function can then be queried for an explanation
 * of plot elements in this picture. In the present case, we ask for the
 * explanation of the square containing coordinate (0,0) inside the heatmap;
 * the {@link CardinalGridCell} part is used to refer to this square. This
 * results in the following graph:
 * <p>
 * <img src="{@docRoot}/doc-files/gnuplot/HeatmapExplanation-exp.png" alt="Explanation graph" />
 * <p>
 * One can see that the explanation for this square in the picture is twofold:
 * it points both to the first (<tt>[0]</tt>) and the third (<tt>[2]</tt>)
 * elements of the input list. This corresponds to the pairs (1,1) and (2,1),
 * which are indeed the only two pairs that fall into this square in the
 * plot, and "explain" its color.
 *
