/**
 * Demonstrates the ability of the {@link HtmlSpreadsheetPrinter} to
 * pretty-print the contents of a spreadsheet as HTML markup. In particular,
 * this example shows how the
 * {@link HtmlSpreadsheetPrinter#mergeCells(boolean) mergeCells} method
 * can group adjacent cells with the same value into a single cell spanning
 * multiple rows or multiple columns.
 * <p>
 * When displayed in a web browser, the printed spreadsheet looks like this:
 * <p>
 * <table border="1">
 * <thead>
 * <tr><th>A</th><th>B</th><th>C</th><th>D</th><th>E</th></tr>
 * </thead>
 * <tr><td rowspan="2">1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td></tr>
 * <tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td rowspan="3">a &lt; b</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>a &lt; b</td></tr>
 * </table>
