/**
 * Demonstrates the ability of the {@link AnsiSpreadsheetPrinter} to
 * pretty-print the contents of a spreadsheet as clear text. In particular,
 * it shows how the printer takes care of giving the same horizontal space
 * to each column on each line.
 * <p>
 * The printed spreadsheet looks like this:
 * <p>
 * <pre> A    B    C D     E    
 * 1    2    3 4     5    
 * 1    3    5 6     7    
 * null null 3 4     a &lt; b
 * 6    7    8 9     a &lt; b
 * 7    8    9 a &lt; b a &lt; b</pre>
